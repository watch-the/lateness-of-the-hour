# The CRISIS

In thinking for some time about writing on this subject, I considered putting together an entire book to explore matters under the title “The CRISIS.” That might still come to fruition at some point, but the breakneck pace of the stage being set for the Tribulation prompted my idea to deal with subjects making up the CRISIS sooner rather than later.

America and the world, through growing anti-God activity, are building one layer of evil on top of the next. This is setting the stage for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. Secular economists and observers of the national and geopolitical movement toward fiscal and every other sort of catastrophe predict coming collapse into—well, they aren’t certain exactly what.

The experts who believe world economic collapse is on the brink have been predicting it for decades. Some think the globalists are deliberately doing things to collapse America and the world so they can be at the center of rebuilding society and culture in their own image. As witness, consider the term “Great Reset,*”* which is encapsulated in Agenda 30, the outline of the many changes proposed by the New World Order builders for the year 2030. (That year, interestingly, is seven years from this one.)

Bible prophecy watchers, in some cases (including myself), particularly have this view that these minions are trying to bring about world collapse. Some believe it’s the globally elite such as Klaus Schwab, George Soros, etc., who will ultimately be able to bring it about. America must go down first, obviously is their thinking, because it is the apex monetary holdup to the rest of the world falling in line with their nefarious plans.

It is my long-standing contention that the collapse, which we’ve been told will happen next month or next year, or sooner or later, will never come because of these people within the Ephesians 6:12 cabal having their way. Neither will the demonic minions within that group be able to bring about the global implosion into dystopia.

They need a CRISIS in order to crash things and implement the devil’s blueprint. They incessantly try to find ways to bring about that CRISIS, which they perceive is necessary to make Americans compliant with their wicked planning.

One of the most obvious attempts to bring about collapse was the pandemic that began in late 2019—the COVID-19 virus. And it was largely successful. The United States suffered significantly from the shutdown of businesses, schools, entertainment, and every other sort of activity, including many churches. This must have been particularly pleasing to the devil.

Yet that CRISIS, which they’re trying to gin up again in anticipation of a presidential election that might go against globalist planning, did not bring about the collapse. America, as well as much of the world, came out of the effort weakened, but in a recovery mode. It will take a more virulent catastrophe to bring the conditions that will allow them to implement Agenda 30—the plan that is seven years in the future.

There has been much talk of stepping up the movement into the Agenda 30 Great Reset effort by the powers that be. On September 19, there are scheduled meetings to catch up on ground lost due to the nations’ recovery from the pandemic and other attempts to bring about collapse. Their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) plan has fallen behind, and the meetings will be designed to get all of the most powerful national governments on board with the globalist efforts of the United Nations, World Economic Forum, World Health Organization, and other would-be masters of the earth.

We’ve looked at all this previously. Here, again, is their dilemma, in their own words. The SDG brief documenting their near-panic states:

A recently released report by the secretary general on “progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals” draws on the latest data to sound the alarm for action. Of the roughly 140 targets with data, only about 12% are on track to be achieved by 2030; and some 30% have either seen no movement or progressed below the 2030 baseline.

Giving up on the SDG or extending the deadline is not an option. The world has been rocked by a series of interlocked crises… Recommitting to the 2030 Agenda is the best roadmap out of these crises, but we are fast running out of time. (“We Need 7 Years of Accelerated, Transformative Action to Achieve Sags,” IISD SDG Knowledge Hub, https://www.un.org/en/desa/we-need-7-years-accelerated-transformative-action-achieve-sdgs, June 13, 2023)

Here is a link that gives greater detail about plans for the September 18–19 SDG summit: http://sdg.iisd.org/news/broadest-possible-agreement-reached-on-sdg-summit-political-declaration/

And now I learn that the UN has just added an Israel-Palestine peace plan involving the Saudis to the SDG Summit agenda. This is a profound development to consider in thinking on the nearness to the tribulation –*Daniel’s seventieth week.*

I believe this summit is Psalms 2:1–12 playing out before our eyes. It is the world of anti-God governing entities slapping God in the face. I believe this display of rebellion will substantially move forward God’s judgment in answering this wicked agglomeration.

The human and demonic minions against which we struggle, according to Paul’s warning in Ephesians, are desperate for their world-rending CRISIS. Their attempts, as mighty as they have been, haven’t been able to bring in their Great Reset so the New World Order can be installed.

Again, I contend that they will never be able to bring on such a global CRISIS. The Holy Spirit is in the business of restraining their evil this side of the Rapture, according to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. God has these evil entities in derision, as predicted in Psalms chapter 2.

That world collapse into dystopia is coming, however. It cannot be stopped. But it will be the God of Heaven, not the human and demonic minions, who will produce the CRISIS that will come when Christ calls to all believers to Himself (1 Corinthians 15:51–55 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18). God’s judgment and wrath against the anti-God rebels of earth will begin to fall that very day, according to the Lord Jesus:

*Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. (Luke 17:26–30)* 

The CRISIS could come at, literally, any tick of the second hand on your watch. You don’t want to be left here in unbelief when Jesus calls those of God’s family. Here is how to make sure you will hear and heed that glorious call.

*That if thou shalt belief in thine heart the lord Jesus, and shalt confess with thy mouth that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10: 9–10)*

TAKE heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

2 Therefore when thou doest *thine* alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:

4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites *are:* for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen *do:* for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as *it* *is* in heaven.

11 Give us this day our daily bread.

12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;

18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great *is* that darkness!

24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, *shall* *he* not much more *clothe* you, O ye of little faith?

31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day *is* the evil thereof.

JUDGE not, that ye be not judged.

2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam *is* in thine own eye?

5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.

6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.

13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide *is* the gate, and broad *is* the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:

14 Because strait *is* the gate, and narrow *is* the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither *can* a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.

22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?

23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:

25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:

27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:

29 For he taught them as *one* having authority, and not as the scribes.
